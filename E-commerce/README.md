The website resembles a real store and you can add products to your cart and pay for them. If you want to try the checkout process, you can use the dummy card number for testing. Please <u><b>DO NOT</b></u> provide real card number and data.

In order to access the admin panel on "/admin" you need to provide the admin email and password.

## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install 
```

## Run

```bash
npx nodemon
```

To run this application, you have to set your own environmental variables. For security reasons, some variables have been hidden from view and used as environmental variables with the help of dotenv package. Below are the variables that you need to set in order to run the application:

- MONGO_URI: this is the connection string of your MongoDB Atlas database.

- SESSION_SECRET: a secret message for the session. You can use any string here.

- ADMIN_Username, ADMIN_Password: the username and password used to log into the admin panel using /Admin. You can put username(admin) and password(admin) here.

Now you can run "npx nodemon" in the terminal and the application should work.
